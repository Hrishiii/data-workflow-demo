# Data Workflow Demo

This repository was created as part of my learning activities for the UTS subject *43030 – Professional Practice in Computing*.

It demonstrates foundational GitHub skills including:

- Version control concepts (commits, branches, merges)
- Workflow automation concepts (YAML, CI/CD pipelines)
- Task management through GitHub Projects

The goal is to showcase professional documentation and repository setup practices aligned with industry standards.
